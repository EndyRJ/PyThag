PyThag is a Python math intepreter built to evaluate mathematical expressions. 

The goal of this project is to help me hone my program-ming skills as a student, as well as provide me with a deeper understanding 
of each step of interpretation in programming. Starting from building the lexer to finally parsing and generating outputs.
